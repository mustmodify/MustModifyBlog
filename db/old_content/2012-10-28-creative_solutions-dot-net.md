I am looking for a way to push payments and invoices to Creative Solutions Accounting version 2012.0.9, Client Bookkeeping Services.

In researching this topic, I found that it's basically impossible to research. "net" is already sort of ambiguous. Add "creative solutions" and Google has no idea what I want.

With that said, I'm not sure whether there is much information out there. I couldn't even find a home page for this software. Apparently it has been deprecated in favor of "Accounting CS", another winner-of-a-name.

I hope to get more information by visiting the clients' office later this week.
