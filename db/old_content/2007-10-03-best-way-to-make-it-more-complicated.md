The project is large. Its scope seems monumental. Decisions are made with the best of intentions. This will make things easier / better / more efficient. Time is the great unit test. Implications are felt. Things snowball. The path becomes wearisome. Investments have been made. Goldberg-style fixes are implemented. Let's just get through this.

Someone suggests a change. Sometimes, in the midst of a journey, it is not time to turn around and go the other way. Sometimes, you must grin and try to cross the mountainous path because going back, although it seems like a more pleasant route, is traveling in the wrong direction.

Then there are rare opportunities to make good decisions.

Let's make the most of them. Wait for those opportunities, then ACT.
