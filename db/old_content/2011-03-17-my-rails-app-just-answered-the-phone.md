&quot;Twilio&quot;:http://www.twilio.com/ apparently offers a &quot;telephone api&quot;:http://www.twilio.com/how-twilio-works and also an SMS API. I get how you could easily set up an SMS API. Pretty cool stuff. But what amazed me what the idea that someone could call a telephone number, which would result in a post to my website... and I would respond with instructions?!?!! 

Ladies and gentlemen, the future is now. My rails app just answered the phone.
