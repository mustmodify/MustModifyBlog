I'll admit upfront that this is such a small compliment it may not be worth a post...  but small compliments are still nice to receive. Thanks to all my clients for good feedback and interesting work.

 I continue to think that, while being productive is important, frequent, honest, humble communication is what keeps clients most happy. My clients will have to be satisfied with frequent and honest.

I thought it was interesting that there's a separate top 25 &quot;software developers&quot; for people who work with winforms-y stuff. Apparently web developers aren't writing software. :)
