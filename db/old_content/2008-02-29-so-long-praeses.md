I'm no longer working at Praeses in Shreveport.

Although the circumstances surrounding my exit have been difficult, the experience was good for me. I met some incredibly friendly and effective people. I've experienced genuine concern for my professional development, and friendship. I've experienced failures and success. I've had some negative interactions and experiences there, too, but I have learned a lot from it all.
