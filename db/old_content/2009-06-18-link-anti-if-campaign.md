 &quot;Anti-If Campaign&quot;:http://www.antiifcampaign.com/ 

&quot;Avoid dangerous IFs and use Object Oriented Principles to build a code that is flexible, changeable and easily testable, and will get rid of a lot of headaches and weekends spent debugging!&quot;

I don't necessarily agree that if statements are _dangerous_. Actually, having read what seems to be the only article on the site, I could abstract to say that newbie developers are far more dangerous than any single construct.

If nothing else the sit is ammusing, on the order of the &quot;Waterfall 2006 Conference&quot;:http://www.waterfall2006.com/ .
