&quot;Color Scheme Designer&quot;:http://colorschemedesigner.com

As any of my clients will tell you, my design skill falls somewhere between &quot;enh&quot; and &quot;meh.&quot; Fortunately, someone smarter than me has found some math that can help. I use this tool to find colors that match the existing colors. Once I've found a set of colors that look good, I can bookmark the color scheme in a folder for that client, and reference it whenever I need to look at their color scheme.

Another great, free tool!
