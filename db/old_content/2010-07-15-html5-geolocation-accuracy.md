I spent some time looking in to HTML5 features this morning. The first one on the list is GeoLocation. This demo gave a position within a block of my house:

Interestingly, when I went to visit the page again, it located me within feet of my previous house, more than 500 miles away. According to the Chrome GeoLocation notes, it uses data including wireless networks to find your location, so I assume Google located my wireless router both places.
