I've tried pair programming remotely a few time recently. I think it's been beneficial, but the lag time is always an issue when you're using screen sharing and Skype. I finally found out that I was using the wrong keywords to look for what I wanted, which was a text-editor that enabled remote pair-programming. The search term that brought me the best results so far is 'collaborative real-time editor'

Here are the ones I'll be testing as soon as I find a willing victim .. uh .. partner.

&quot;Gobby&quot;:http://gobby.0x539.de/ - can be served locally, but you'll need to open ports on your router &quot;Collab&quot;:http://collab.netbeans.org/ - for netbeans, requires a server 
&quot;Cola&quot;:http://vimeo.com/1195398 - for eclipse
