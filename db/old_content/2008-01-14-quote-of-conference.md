My favorite quote from the AltDotNet conference in Austin:

---
&quot;All you've got to do is write the documentation that distracts the SOX guys and you're good.&quot;
---

I have no problems with documentation. My problem is with people who assume that if some documentation is good, lots of documentation is better.
