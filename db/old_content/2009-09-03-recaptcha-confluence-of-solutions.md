One of the things I appreciate about good design is the way two complex problems can be solved more elegantly together than separately. A great example of this is &quot;reCAPTCHA&quot;:http://www.recaptcha.net . It prevents bots from submitting forms _and_ helps &quot;digitize books, newspapers, and old time radio shows&quot; ... they've used crowd-sourcing to replace OCR while fighting spam. Brilliant.
