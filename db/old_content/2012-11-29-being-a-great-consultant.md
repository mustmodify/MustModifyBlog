I thought this post was insightful, if repetitive. I recognized just about all of the issues discussed as things that have been problems for me at some point.

* The need for professionalism
** If you're being paid, it isn't a hobby. Act professionally.
** Don't disappear.
** Communicate early and often. 
** Coworkers and clients should rarely know you work from home... ie avoid &quot;hold on, neighbor is at the door.&quot; or &quot;my wife wants me to ______&quot; ( still struggling to get the wife to accept this one. )
** no one is watching you, so you have to be that much more vigilant about not skipping work, not being sloppy, etc.

* Balance passion for work with a consultant's distance
** don't fall in love with your task list.
** Have great ideas, but don't be upset if the client goes a different direction. It's their money.

* Consultants must balance home and work
** stick to an 8-ish hour day whenever possible
** Rest on weekends.

* Get things done, but done well. Don't seek perfection, but don't commit junk. After reading &quot;Good to Great&quot;, I am fascinated with the idea that tension is a critical part of all good decisions.
