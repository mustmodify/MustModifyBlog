Every developer should watch &quot;What killed SmallTalk could it kill Ruby, too.&quot;:http://railsconf.blip.tv/file/2089545/ from RailsConf. This is a whirlwind tour through the history of software development from Small Talk to C++ to Ruby. It is both ammusing and informative.

He also talks about two of my favorite subjects, &quot;Test Driven Development&quot;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development andÂ  &quot;Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)&quot;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt .

Good times.
