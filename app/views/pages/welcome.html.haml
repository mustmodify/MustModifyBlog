/     %h3 Ideal Clients
/
/     %p My ideal clients are small to mid-sized businesses that want to leverage custom software to solve problems and create opportunities but that donâ€™t have the internal capacity to develop this software themselves. I provide the most value when I work on business-critical software with a stakeholder who doesn't necessarily want to understand the technology end -- they just want to tell me about their business problems and then go back to growing the business.
/
/     %p Although it's always fun to get involved in projects during the conceptual phase so I can help architect solutions from scratch, I'm completely open to working with existing projects and slowly moving the needle towards greater maintainability. In either situation, I look to address the right problems in something approaching the right order within the available budget.
/
/     %p But I have also been brought in to help rescue projects that have failed at some point along the way, especially when it's not clear to the stakeholders what might be the actual issue preventing completion.
/
/     %p I look to work with clients who see me as their partner in turning customer software into real solutions that help grow their businesses.
