    %p My ideal clients are small to mid-sized businesses that want to leverage custom software to solve problems and create opportunities but that donâ€™t have the internal capacity to develop this software themselves. I provide the most value when I work on business-critical software with a stakeholder who doesn't necessarily want to understand the technology end -- they just want to tell me about their business problems and then go back to growing the business.

    %p But I have also been brought in to help rescue projects that have failed at some point along the way, especially when it's not clear to the stakeholders what might be the actual issue preventing completion.

    %p I look to work with clients who see me as their partner in turning customer software into real solutions that help grow their businesses.
