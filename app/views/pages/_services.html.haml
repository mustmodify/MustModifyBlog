        %h3.service-name Speaking English

        %p My goal is to make sure you don't have to understand techno-babble. Whether that's turning your business needs into technical requirements, talking with potential vendors to determine the risks and liklihood of success, or weeding out people who throw around buzzwords from those who have actual skill, I'm happy to be your translator.

        %h3.service-name Project Review

        %p
          Having worked with some of the best minds in the software community (including
          %a{href: 'https://www.nasa.gov'} NASA
          and
          %a{href: 'http://www.thoughtworks.com'} ThoughtWorks
          ) I have a good understanding of projects, what makes them go well, and what makes them stall. I can provide insight into how to make projects more successful, move faster, and operate more smoothly.
